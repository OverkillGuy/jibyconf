#+TITLE: Bootstrapping an Emacs configuration

In order for my Emacs configuration to become +sentient+ useful, I
need to be able to launch a single command which bootstraps the entire
emacs environment.

This involves reading my config files, and toggling the ones that are
relevant, like enabling X11-related config when the screen supports
graphics.

My config files are laid out in Org mode files, contained inside code
snippets, surrounded by the reasoning surrounding them.
The ideal bootstrapping system would load these text files, parse the
code blocks and load them. This is what I attempt to do here.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; Make sure we tangle from this folder
(cd buffer-file-name)
(require 'org)
; Load first what requires no extra module
(org-babel-load-file "vanilla-config.org")
;; Then what requires modules
(org-babel-load-file "config.org")
(if (display-graphic-p)
    (org-babel-load-file "config-X11.org"))
;; Android package-level usernames
(if (string-match "u[0-9]_a[0-9+]" (user-login-name))
    (org-babel-load-file "termux-emacs-config.org"))
(org-babel-tangle-file "snippets.org")
#+END_SRC
