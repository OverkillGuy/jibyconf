Using part of [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Isync][Archlinux wiki on mbsync]] for setup and some
try-and-fail. I've chosen to use =mbsync= (package name "isync")
instead of the more popular but slower =offlineimap=.

You need to build from source to support SSL correctly (=apt-get= has
an old version of mbsync)
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle no
git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/isync/isync
#+END_SRC

Build from source
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle no
cd ~/Documents/dev-local/isync
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

* Setup

Create new file =~/.mbsyncrc=.

Create the mailboxes just in case it didn't exist.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle no
mkdir -p ~/mail/some_mailbox/
#+END_SRC
Then run a test sync:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle no
mbsync -a
#+END_SRC

Should show no error, with instead a lot of folders being downloaded
