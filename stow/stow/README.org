#+TITLE: Stow configuration

The =.stowrc= file describes the default target for deployment being =~/=,
and the other file is an ignore list for READMEs and other org-mode
files.

Combined, these files enable config to be defined using litterate
programming via org-mode, writing blog-post-style "articles" like
=README.org= about configuration, including code snippets, all the while
allowing for config blocks to be exported to separate files for
deployment.

The commands were borrowed from [[https://github.com/SamuelTissot/dotfiles/tree/linux][SamuelTissot/dotfiles]], adding an
org-mode twist.
