#+TITLE: Stow configuration

Enable config to be defined using litterate programming via org-mode,
writing blog-post-style "articles" like =README.org= about
configuration, including code snippets, all the while allowing for
config blocks to be exported to separate files for deployment.

The commands were borrowed from [[https://github.com/SamuelTissot/dotfiles/tree/linux][SamuelTissot/dotfiles]], adding an
org-mode twist.

* Stowrc

The =.stowrc= file describes the default target for deployment being =~/=,
which means one can be deep in the stow folder and run =stow emacs= and
deploy correctly without need for =-t ~=.

#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle .stowrc
--target=~
#+END_SRC

We also want to see what file goes where, which a verbose flag covers:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle .stowrc
--verbose
#+END_SRC

* Stow ignore

Similar to gitignore lists, which come in local (per
repository/directory) form as well as global list per user, GNU Stow
allows a global ignore list. This is handy to avoid wrongly deploying
non-deployable files that still fit inside the stow "package".


First, do not deploy the README files for these packages, markdown or
otherwise:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle .stow-global-ignore
README.*
#+END_SRC

And more generally, none of the org-mode file need deploying:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle .stow-global-ignore
.*\.org
#+END_SRC

Lastly, do not deploy patch files, used to deploy loaders for
bash/emacs config during new machine deployment:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle .stow-global-ignore
.*\.patch
#+END_SRC
